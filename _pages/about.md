I am a PhD candidate in applied machine learning at the Knowledge Discovery Lab in Computer Science Department at UMass Boston advised by Prof. Ding Wei.

My Ph.D. research focused on developing applied machine learning algorithms to solve real-world computational problems, mainly focused on Spatio-temporal analysis and time series forecasting. 
I am also passionate about applying causal analysis techniques in feature selection to study how to get the principal features from the original feature space. 
 
Before UMass Boston, I had been a software engineer in China for over 8 years, which helps me get accumulated substantial hands-on expertise on designing and writing code in both the client-side and server-side. I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts, Boston in 2016. Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science from the Harbin Engineering University in Harbin, China.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and hiking with friends and family.
